# DTDL Parser

## Overview

This is a DTDL Parser for Rust, based on the [JavaScript DTDL Parser](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/%40azure/dtdl-parser_1.0.0-beta.2/sdk/digitaltwins/dtdl-parser).  Currently, it only provides a subset of the functionality of the JavaScript DTDL Parser.
