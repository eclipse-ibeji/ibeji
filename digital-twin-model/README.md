# Digital Twin Model

## Specifying the Digital Twin Model
The digital twin model is specified using [DTDL V3](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v3/DTDL.v3.md). The DTDL is stored under the `digital-twin-model/dtdl` folder and each file defines a DTDL interface.

DTDL's behavior is defined by several metamodel classes. Initially, we will only use some of these metamodel classes, namely, Interface, Property, Command and Relationship.

## DTDL Instance Representation in JSON-LD

Instances of DTDL models are represented as JSON-LD objects. Each instance is a JSON object that includes the `@context`, `@id`, and `@type` fields, as well as any properties defined in the model.

The `@context` field provides the context required for interpreting the JSON-LD document. The `@id` field is a unique identifier for the instance, and the `@type` field specifies the DTDL model that the instance is based on. The properties of the instance are represented as key-value pairs in the JSON object.

Here's an example of a DTDL instance represented in JSON-LD:

```json
{
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;3",
  "@id": "dtmi:com:example:Thermostat:device1;1",  // Unique identifier for the instance
  "@type": "dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1",  // The DTDL model that the instance is based on
  "Temperature": 20.0,  // Property defined in the model
  "TargetTemperature": 22.0,  // Property defined in the model
  "MaxTempSinceLastReset": 25.0  // Property defined in the model
}
```

In this example, the `@context` field specifies the version of DTDL being used. For DTDL version 3, the appropriate context specifier is `dtmi:dtdl:context;3`. The `@id` field is a unique identifier for the thermostat device instance, and the `@type` field specifies that the instance is based on the `dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1` model. The `Temperature`, `TargetTemperature`, and `MaxTempSinceLastReset` fields are properties defined in the model, and their values are set for this specific instance.

In DTDL, a **Relationship** is a directional link from a source digital twin to a target digital twin. Relationships are used to create and navigate the graph of digital twins.

Here's an example of how a relationship might be represented in a DTDL model:

```json
{
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;3",
  "@id": "dtmi:com:example:Building;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "displayName": "Building",
  "contents": [
    {
      "@type": "Relationship",
      "name": "hasFloor",
      "minMultiplicity": 0,
      "maxMultiplicity": 100,
      "target": "dtmi:com:example:Floor;1"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the `hasFloor` relationship represents a link from a `Building` instance to a `Floor` instance¹. The `minMultiplicity` and `maxMultiplicity` fields specify that a `Building` can have between 0 and 100 `Floor` instances. The `target` field specifies the DTDL model that the target of the relationship is based on.

And here's an example of how a relationship might be represented in a DTDL instance:

```json
{
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;3",
  "@id": "dtmi:com:example:Building:building1;1",  // Unique identifier for the instance
  "@type": "dtmi:com:example:Building;1",  // The DTDL model that the instance is based on
  "hasFloor": [
    "dtmi:com:example:Floor:floor1;1",
    "dtmi:com:example:Floor:floor2;1"
  ]
}
```

In this example, the `hasFloor` field is an array of identifiers for `Floor` instances that are related to the `Building` instance.


## Using the Digital Twin Model in the Code

The digital twin providers and consumers need to use the Digital Twin Model to perform digital twin interactions:
- They need to use the model identifiers (denoted by "@id" in the DTDL) to identify the part of the model that they want or use.
- They need and the model names (denoted by "name" in the DTDL model) to identify the member of a model part that they want or use.
- They need property definitions to exchange the associated values.
- They need commands definitions of their request and response to send and receive the appropriate payloads.

We need to make this content accessible as code.  Each programming language will need its own variant.  We will discuss what a Rust
variant may look like.  For Rust, we will place all of the code for the model's content in a single file named after the model and its version.  In this
repository it will be the 'digital-twin-model/src/sdv_v1.rs' file.

The sdv_v1.rs file is based on the model content from the DTDL files located under 'digital-twin-model/dtdl/dtmi/sdv'.

The sdv_v1.rs file will setup namespaces based on the DTMIs used in the DTDL files.  These namespaces will allow developers to provide fully
qualified names that look similar to the DTMIs (minus the 'dtmi:sdv:' prefix).

For each namespace, we will define:
- Constants for model ids (“ID”), model descriptions (“DESCRIPTION”), and model member names (“NAME”).
- Structs named “TYPE” to define property values, command request payloads, command response payloads, and schema types.
